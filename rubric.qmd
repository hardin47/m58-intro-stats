# Assessment Criteria

The <a href = "https://m58-intro-stats.netlify.app/slides/Rubric_m58_s23_Islands.docx" target = "_blank">grading rubric</a> tries to lay out the main aspects of the project inluding the analysis parts and the communication parts.  Please ask if you have any questions.

## Final Report

### Introduction

The introduction should include:

*  Brief background (Has an explanation been given for why the research was done? Why is the work important? What is its relevance?)
*  Objective or Research question (Is the brief description of the hypothesis/goals and findings of the paper clearly stated for the reader?)

### Methods

Methods should include description of:

*  Study design (enough info for someone to replicate)
*  Sampling method and eligibility criteria
*  Treatment (i.e., explanatory variable)
*  Outcome definition(s) (i.e., response variable)
*  Sample size justification
*  Statistical methods which were applied

### Results

Results should communicate / describe / summarize:

*  Baseline data (including numbers analyzed â€“ explain the explanatory variables, summarize the explanatory variables, plot the explanatory variables, etc.)
*  Outcomes (explain the response variable, summarize the response variable, plot the response variable).  Is your treatment liable to do harm?  Are you worried about type I vs type II errors when considering the outcome?
*  Each model is completely described
*  Each figure / table is completely described
*  Connections between analyses; e.g., between figures and model results
*  Discussion
*  Conclusion (i.e., answer to the research question), interpretation
*  Limitations
*  Ideas for future studies

### Coverage, Clarity

Full analysis should be clear, concise, well-organized, reproducible, and engaging:

*  Dataset is complete, available, tidy (rows are observations, columns are variables, no exceptions)
*  All information was provided
*  Presentation was organized
*  Presentation was clear, understandable
*  Tables and figures were used well (axes labeled, etc.)
*  Work is completely reproducible (the instructor must be able to run the .Rmd file on their own computer)  


## Peer/self rubric

Each of you will evaluate your own work and that of your peers keeping the following topics in mind.

   * Mastery of the material (understanding of the material is strong and well communicated)
   * Background, completeness (thoroughly explains all key points)
   * Presentation evaluation (organized, communicates effectively with the audience)
