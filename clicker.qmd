   (c)	8
   (d)	9
   (e)	10


[^1]:  c.	8

---

65. The following is a correct interpretation of the CI:[^65]  

> 95% confident that the interval includes the sample proportion who believe that the global poverty rate has doubled. 

   a. TRUE
   b. FALSE

[^65]: a. TRUE

66.  The following is a correct interpretation of the CI:[^66]

   a. TRUE
   b. FALSE

[^66]: b. FALSE (we are 95% confident that the new interval will contain the true value.  We do not think that the new interval will be the same as the original interval.)

67.  Let's say that the null hypothesis (e.g., p=0.47) is TRUE.   My level of significance is 0.03 (reject if p-value < 0.03). How often will I reject the null hypothesis?[^67]
     (a) 1 % of the time
     (b) 3% of the time
     (c) 5 % of the time
     (d) 95% of the time
     (e) 97% of the time

[^67]: b. 3% of the time

---

What does "of the time" mean???

It means in repeated samples.  That is, in 3% of all datasets we'd take from that exact same population, we would mistakenly reject the actually true hypothesis that p=0.47.

---

[^68]: e. 97% of the time

What does "of the time" mean???

It means in repeated samples.  That is, in 97% of all datasets we'd take from that exact same population, we would capture the true population proportion of 0.47.

     c. decrease

[^70]: b. stays the same (the population size has no effect on the sampling distribution of the statistic)

71. Suppose the sample is 10 times larger.  The variability of the data:[^71]
     a. increases
     b. stays the same
     c. decrease

79. Making your significance level more stringent ($\alpha$ smaller)[^79]

81. Is the Alienâ€™s interval for the true proportion of all humans who self-identify as female consistent with your lived experience?[^81]
    (a) Yes
    (b) No
    (c) I donâ€™t understand what the confidence interval represents.

[^81]: b. No.  My experience is that close to 50% of humans self-identify as female.

---

82. As weâ€™ve seen with the applet, about 5% of all 95% intervals fail to capture the actual value of the population parameter.  Do you think the alien just got a "red" interval?[^82]
    (a)	Yes
    (b)	No

[^82]: b. No.  They didn't just "get unlucky".  Instead, the reason the interval failed to capture the true parameter is because the sample was not representative of the population.  

---

83.	 Would it be reasonable for the alien to conclude, with 95% confidence, that between 16.5% and 33.5% of US Senators in the year 2023 self-identify as female?[^83]
     (a)	Yes
     (b)	No

[^83]: b. No. We know (for sure, with 100% confidence) that exactly 25% of U.S. senators in 2019 self identify as female. If thatâ€™s the entire population of interest, thereâ€™s no reason to calculate a confidence interval.

    (a)	Random sampling
    (b)	Random assignment
    (c)	Both
    (d)	Neither

[^87]: b. Random assignment.  Randomly decide which exams to grade with which pen, and then record the scores.

    (a)	Random sampling
    (b)	Random assignment
    (c)	Both

90. In order to find a CI for the true RR, our steps are:[^90]  
Step 1. ln(RR-hat)  
Step 2. add Â± z* sqrt( 1/A - 1/(A+C) + 1/B - 1/(B+D) )  
Step 3. find exp of the endpoints   
    (a) because the sampling distribution of RR is normal
    (b) because RR is typically greater than 1
    (c) because the ln transformation makes the sampling distribution almost normal
    (d) because RR is invariant to the choice of explanatory or response variable

[^90]: c. because the ln transformation makes the sampling distribution almost normal

---

91. In finding a CI for $p_1$/$p_2$, why is it okay to exponentiate the end points of the interval for ln($p_1$/$p_2$)?[^91]

    (b) the natural log of the RR makes the distribution approximately normal.
    (c) the natural log compresses values that are > 1 and spreads values < 1.

[^91]: a. if ln($p_1$/$p_2$) is in the natural log-interval, $p_1$/$p_2$ will be in the exponentiated interval.  (Where "okay" means you have 95% coverage in repeated samples.)

Step 2. add Â± z* sqrt( 1/A + 1/B + 1/C + 1/D )  
Step 3. find exp of the endpoints   
     (a) because the sampling distribution of OR is normal
     (b) because OR is typically greater than 1
     (c) because the ln transformation makes the sampling distribution almost normal
     (d) because OR is invariant to the choice of explanatory or response variable

[^93]: c. because the ln transformation makes the sampling distribution almost normal

---

97.  When we randomly select individuals based on the explanatory variable, we cannot accurately measure[^97]
     (a) the proportion of people in the population in each explanatory category
     (b) the proportion of people in the population in each response group
     (c) anything about the population
     (d) confounding variables
 
[^97]: a. the proportion of people in the population in each explanatory category

---

98. The odds ratio is invariant to which variable is explanatory and which is response means:[^98]
    (a) we always put the bigger odds in the numerator
    (b) we must collect data so that we can estimate the response in the population
    (c) which variable is called the explanatory changes the value of the OR
    (d) which variable is called the explanatory does not change the value of the OR

[^98]: d. which variable is called the explanatory does not change the value of the OR

     (a) one-sided alt hypothesis, and we only consider the upper end of the sampling distribution
     (b) one-sided alt hypothesis, and we consider both ends of the sampling distribution
     (c) two-sided alt hypothesis, and we only consider the upper end of the sampling distribution
     (d) two-sided alt hypothesis, and we consider both ends of the sampling distribution

     (a) causation 
     (b) population characteristics

[^104]: b. population characteristics

---

105. Based on the night light / myopia example, the correct conclusion is:[^105]
     (a) the p-value is small, so sleeping in a lit room makes it more likely that you are near-sighted. 
     (b) the p-value is small, so sleeping in a dark room makes it more likely that you are near-sighted. 
     (c) the p-value is small, so a higher proportion of children who sleep in light rooms are near-sighted than who sleep in dark rooms. 
     (d) $\hat{p}_{\mbox{near}}$ if lit room = 41/75 = 0.547 and    $\hat{p}_{\mbox{near}}$ if dark = 18/172 = 0.105, therefore sleeping with the light on is bad for you. 

[^105]: c. the p-value is small, so a higher proportion of children who sleep in light rooms are near-sighted than who sleep in dark rooms.

---

106. A possible confounding variable for the night light study is:[^106]
     (a) low birth weight
     (b) race (70% of the children were white)
     (c) region of the country where the clinic was located

[^106]: a. low birth weight (the argument needs to be made that the confounding variable is associated with both the explanatory and the response variable)

  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "up") + 
  xlab("") +

     (b) Because the Coast Guard certifies vessels according to average weight.
     (c) Because the average is less variable than the sum.
     (d) Because the average has a normal distribution and the sum doesnâ€™t.

[^115]: a. So that it is easier to infer from the sample to the population

---

116. When the population is skewed right, the sampling distribution for the sample mean will be[^116]

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

63.	A newspaper article claims that the average age for people who receive food stamps is 40 years. You believe that the average age is less than that. You take a random sample of 100 people who receive food stamps and find their average age to be 39.2 years. You find that this is significantly lower than the age of 40 stated in the article (p < 0.05). What would be an appropriate interpretation of this result?
(a) The statistically significant result indicates that the majority of people who receive food stamps is younger than 40.
(b) Although the result is statistically significant, the difference in age is not of practical importance.
(c) An error must have been made. This difference is too small to be statistically significant.
64.	In order to investigate a claim that the average time required for the county fire department to respond to a reported fire is greater than 5 minutes, county staff determined the response times for 40 randomly selected fire reports.  The data was used to test H0:  Î¼ = 5 versus Ha:  Î¼ > 5 and the computed p-value was 0.12.  If a 0.05 level of significance is used, what conclusions can be drawn?

(a) There is convincing evidence that the mean response time is 5 minutes (or less).
(b) There is convincing evidence that the mean response time is greater than 5 minutes.
(c) There is not convincing evidence that the mean response time is greater than 5 minutes.â€ƒ
