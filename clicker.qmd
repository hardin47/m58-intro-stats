1. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says:[^1]
   a. The sample average (statistic) converges to the true   average (parameter)
   b. The sample average (statistic) converges to some point
   c. The distribution of the sample average (statistic) converges to a normal distribution
   d. The distribution of the sample average (statistic) converges to some distribution
   e. I have no idea what the CLT says
   

[^1]:  c. The distribution of the sample average (statistic) converges to a normal distribution

   b. the means are quite variable
   c. we like the letter t
   d. we have two samples
   e. we don’t know the true standard deviation parameter
