   (c)	8
   (d)	9
   (e)	10


[^1]:  c.	8

---

65. The following is a correct interpretation of the CI:[^65]  

> 95% confident that the interval includes the sample proportion who believe that the global poverty rate has doubled. 

   a. TRUE
   b. FALSE

[^65]: a. TRUE

66.  The following is a correct interpretation of the CI:[^66]  

> If researchers were to select a new sample of 1005 adult Americans, then we're 95% confident that between 56% and 62% of those people would answer "doubled" to the question. 

   a. TRUE
   b. FALSE

[^66]: b. FALSE (we are 95% confident that the new interval will contain the true value.  We do not think that the new interval will be the same as the original interval.)

67.  Letâ€™s say that the null hypothesis (e.g., p=0.47) is TRUE.   My level of significance is 0.03 (reject if p-value < 0.03). How often will I reject the null hypothesis?[^67]
     (a) 1 % of the time
     (b) 3% of the time
     (c) 5 % of the time
     (d) 95% of the time
     (e) 97% of the time

[^67]: b. 3% of the time

What does "of the time" mean???

It means in repeated samples.  That is, in 3% of all datasets we'd take from that exact same population, we would mistakenly reject the actually true hypothesis that p=0.47.

68. Letâ€™s say that the null hypothesis (e.g., p=0.47) is TRUE.   My level of significance is 0.03.  
How often will p be in a 97% confidence interval?[^68]
    (a) 1 % of the time
    (b) 3% of the time
    (c) 5 % of the time
    (d) 95% of the time
    (e) 97% of the time

[^68]: e. 97% of the time

---

What does "of the time" mean???

It means in repeated samples.  That is, in 97% of all datasets we'd take from that exact same population, we would capture the true population proportion of 0.47.

69.  Suppose the sample is 10 times larger.  The SE of the statistic:[^69]
     a. increases
     b. stays the same
     c. decrease

[^69]: c. decreases

---

70.  Suppose the population is 10 times larger.  The SE of the statistic:[^70]
     a. increases
     b. stays the same
     c. decrease

[^70]: b. stays the same (the population size has no effect on the sampling distribution of the statistic)

---

71. Suppose the sample is 10 times larger.  The variability of the data:[^71]
     a. increases
     b. stays the same
     c. decrease

[^71]: b. stays the same (the variability of the data should be the same as the variability of the population, regardless of the sample size)

10.	 The "random" part in clinical trials typically comes from:[^10]
    (a) random samples
    (b) random allocation of treatment

[^10]: b. random allocation of treatment

11. The "random" part in polling typically comes from:[^11]
    (a) random samples
    (b) random allocation of treatment

[^11]: random samples

74. You want to collect data to investigate whether teenagers in the United States have read fewer Harry Potter books (from the original series of seven books) than teenagers in the United Kingdom.  Would you make use of random sampling, random assignment, both, or neither?  

(a)	Random sampling
(b)	Random assignment
(c)	Both
(d)	Neither

75.	An instructor wants to investigate whether using a red pen to grade assignments leads to lower scores on exams than using a blue pen to grade assignments.  Would you advise the professor to make use of random sampling, random assignment, both, or neither?  

(a)	Random sampling
(b)	Random assignment
(c)	Both
(d)	Neither

76.	A student decides to investigate whether NFL football games played in indoor stadiums tend to have more points scored than games played outdoors.  The student examines points scored in every NFL game of the 2019 season. Has the student used random sampling, random assignment, both, or neither? 

(a)	Random sampling
(b)	Random assignment
(c)	Both
(d)	Neither
