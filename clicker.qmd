   (d)	9
   (e)	10


[^1]:  c.	8

   a. TRUE
   b. FALSE

[^66]: b. FALSE (we are 95% confident that the new interval will contain the true value.  We do not think that the new interval will be the same as the original interval.)

What does "of the time" mean???

It means in repeated samples.  That is, in 3% of all datasets we'd take from that exact same population, we would mistakenly reject the actually true hypothesis that p=0.47.

     a. increases
     b. stays the same
     c. decrease

81. Is the Alien's interval for the true proportion of all humans who self-identify as female consistent with your lived experience?[^81]
    (a) Yes
    (b) No
    (c) I don't understand what the confidence interval represents.

[^81]: b. No.  My experience is that close to 50% of humans self-identify as female.

---

82. As we've seen with the applet, about 5% of all 95% intervals fail to capture the actual value of the population parameter.  Do you think the alien just got a "red" interval?[^82]
    (a)	Yes
    (b)	No

[^82]: b. No.  They didn't just "get unlucky".  Instead, the reason the interval failed to capture the true parameter is because the sample was not representative of the population.  

---

83.	 Would it be reasonable for the alien to conclude, with 95% confidence, that between 16.5% and 33.5% of US Senators in the year 2023 self-identify as female?[^83]
     (a)	Yes
     (b)	No

[^83]: b. No. We know (for sure, with 100% confidence) that exactly 25% of U.S. senators in 2019 self identify as female. If that's the entire population of interest, there's no reason to calculate a confidence interval.

    (b)	Random assignment
    (c)	Both

    (a)	Random sampling
    (b)	Random assignment

Step 3. find exp of the endpoints   
    (a) because the sampling distribution of RR is normal
    (b) because RR is typically greater than 1

91. In finding a CI for $p_1$/$p_2$, why is it okay to exponentiate the end points of the interval for ln($p_1$/$p_2$)?[^91] 
    (a) if ln($p_1$/$p_2$) is in the natural log-interval, $p_1$/$p_2$ will be in the exponentiated interval.
    (b) the natural log of the RR makes the distribution approximately normal.
    (c) the natural log compresses values that are > 1 and spreads values < 1.

[^91]: a. if ln($p_1$/$p_2$) is in the natural log-interval, $p_1$/$p_2$ will be in the exponentiated interval.  (Where "okay" means you have 95% coverage in repeated samples.)

Step 2. add ± z* sqrt( 1/A + 1/B + 1/C + 1/D )  
Step 3. find exp of the endpoints   
     (a) because the sampling distribution of OR is normal
     (b) because OR is typically greater than 1
     (c) because the ln transformation makes the sampling distribution almost normal

From the NYT, March 21, 2023, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/sports/basketball/tall-basketball-march-madness.html

> The average W.N.B.A. player, at a shade taller than 6 feet, towers over the average American woman (5 feet 3.5 inches). American men who are between 6 feet and 6-2 — significantly taller than the 5-9 average — have about a five in a million chance of making the N.B.A., according to "The Sports Gene," a 2013 book by David Epstein about the science of athletic performance. But if you hit the genetic lottery and happen to be 7 feet tall, your chances of landing in the N.B.A. are roughly one in six. (There are 38 players on active rosters who are 7 feet or taller, according to N.B.A. Advanced Stats; the average height of an N.B.A. player is 6 feet 6.5 inches.)

98. The odds ratio is invariant to which variable is explanatory and which is response means:[^98]
    (a) we always put the bigger odds in the numerator
    (b) we must collect data so that we can estimate the response in the population
    (c) which variable is called the explanatory changes the value of the OR
    (d) which variable is called the explanatory does not change the value of the OR

[^98]: d. which variable is called the explanatory does not change the value of the OR 

---

99.  One reason we should be careful interpreting relative risks is if:[^99]

104. If we sample randomly from a population, the conclusions we can make are about:[^104]
     (a) causation 
     (b) population characteristics

[^104]: b. population characteristics

---

105. Based on the night light / myopia example, the correct conclusion is:[^105]
     (a) the p-value is small, so sleeping in a lit room makes it more likely that you are near-sighted. 
     (b) the p-value is small, so sleeping in a dark room makes it more likely that you are near-sighted. 
     (c) the p-value is small, so a higher proportion of children who sleep in light rooms are near-sighted than who sleep in dark rooms. 
     (d) $\hat{p}_{\mbox{near}}$ if lit room = 41/75 = 0.547 and    $\hat{p}_{\mbox{near}}$ if dark = 18/172 = 0.105, therefore sleeping with the light on is bad for you.

     (c) Because the average is less variable than the sum.
     (d) Because the average has a normal distribution and the sum doesn't.

[^115]: a. So that it is easier to infer from the sample to the population

134. A newspaper article claims that the average age for people who receive food stamps is 40 years. You believe that the average age is lower. You take a random sample of 100 people who receive food stamps and find their average age to be 39.2 years. You find that 39.2 is significantly lower than the age of 40 stated in the article (p < 0.05). What would be an appropriate interpretation of the result?[^134]

     (c) 95% of GPAs (for students with 10 absences) are between 3.20 and 3.42.
     (d) We are 95% confident that the true mean GPA (for students with 10 absences) is between 3.20 and 3.42.
     (e) 95% of our intervals will have a mean GPA between 3.20 and 3.42.

[^177]: d. We are 95% confident that the true mean GPA (for students with 10 absences) is between 3.20 and 3.42.

178. We created a 95% prediction interval for an individual GPA given 10 absences to be (3, 3.62).  What is the correct interpretation?[^178]
     (a) There is a 95% chance that the mean GPA of students with 10 absences is between 3 and 3.62.
     (b) 95% of GPA averages (for students with 10 absences) are between 3 and 3.62.
     (c) 95% of GPAs (for students with 10 absences) are between 3 and 3.62.
     (d) We are 95% confident that the true mean GPA (for students with 10 absences) is between 3 and 3.62.
     (e) 95% of our intervals will have a mean GPA between 3 and 3.62.

[^178]: b. 95% of GPA averages (for students with 10 absences) are between 3 and 3.62.  It is also totally okay to interpret the interval as: there is a 95% chance that if I randomly select someone with 10 absences, their GPA will be between 3 and 3.62.

179. Prediction intervals and confidence intervals have the same technical conditions:[^179]
     (a) TRUE
     (b) FALSE
     (c) sort of

[^179]: c. sort of.  Both methods require the data to be normally distributed (for one sample mean, the variable is normal; for linear regression, the residuals are normal).  However, if you have a large enough sample size, the CLT kicks in when building the mean interval  The CLT does not ever help for prediction intervals, so you always need normal data to have reasonable prediction intervals.

180. It is often a good idea to transform the variable(s)...[^180]
     (a) ... to find the highest R2 value.
     (b) ... when the X variable is not normally distributed.
     (c) ... to make the model easier to interpret.
     (d) ... so that the technical conditions are met.

[^180]: d. ... so that the technical conditions are met. (And often transforming makes the results harder to interpret.)

181. A large value of $R^2$ says...[^181]
      a. the technical conditions hold.
      b. the variability in the response is well explained by the explanatory variable(s).
      c. the explanatory variable(s) determine the response variable.  
      d. the explanatory variable(s) are significant.

[^181]: b. the variability in the response is well explained by the explanatory variable(s).
