## Pilot

The <a href = "https://m58-intro-stats.netlify.app/slides/Pilot_m58_s22_Islands.docx" target = "_blank">pilot project</a> will be based on a preliminary data collection.  Details about the structure of the data are given in the assignment, note that the response variable must be numerical.  You will have an opportunity to collect more data as we go, but the better the original data are, the better the follow-up data collection will be.
